                Hello! I'm Jerry Gong, a current second year computer science and statistics double major
                at UCSD. I was born in Guangzhou, China at April 22, 2003 and came to USA since high school.
                I went to Our Lady of Lourdes High School at Poughkeepsie, NY and decided that I would like
                to escape from the Eastcoast. It was during high school that I found my passion for computer
                science
