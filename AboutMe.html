            <p>
                Hello! I'm Jerry Gong, a current second year computer science and statistics double major
                at UCSD. I was born in Guangzhou, China at April 22, 2003 and came to USA since high school.
                I went to Our Lady of Lourdes High School at Poughkeepsie, NY and decided that I would like
                to escape from the Eastcoast. It was during high school that I found my passion for computer
                science. I am currently looking for a software engineer internship. I work well on teams and 
                have good communication skills. I am eager to learn new skills and technologies in order to
                maximize my contribution to the company during my employment!
